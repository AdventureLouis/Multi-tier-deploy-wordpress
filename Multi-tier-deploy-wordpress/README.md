Multi-tier wordpress deployment in AWS  leveraging the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform!
<br>
In this project I automated the entire process using Terraform.
<br>
Below are AWS services which I used:
<br>
**VPC**: A secure and isolated virtual network for all resources.
<br>
**Amazon EC2**: A scalable EC2 instance hosting the WordPress application.
<br>
**Bastion EC2**: An added layer of security for accessing the infrastructure.
<br>
**Amazon RDS for MySQL**: A managed database service for WordPress, ensuring reliability and ease of management.
<br>
**Amazon Route 53**: Efficient DNS routing for seamless access to the site.
<br>
**Elastic Load Balancer**: Distributing incoming traffic for high availability.
<br>
**AWS IAM**: Granular access control and security management.
<br>
In this latest iteration, I've automated the entire infrastructure provisioning process using Terraform. This streamlines deployments and enhances consistency and repeatability.
<br>
Furthermore, I've integrated even more AWS services into this Terraform-managed setup:
<br>
**AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely managing sensitive information like database credentials.
<br>
**Domain Name Management**: Automating the management and association of the domain name within the AWS environment.
<br>
This update has provided invaluable experience applying IaC principles and further solidifies the infrastructure's reliability, scalability, and security. It's exciting to see how 
Terraform can automate and enhance cloud deployments!

**LucidChart**: For designing architecture
